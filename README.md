# Quake Tools

Quake Tools is a modern C++ reimplementation of the original Quake development
tools, focused on accuracy, portability, and maintainability. Inspired by the
spirit of classic development environments, this project aims to preserve
original
behavior while making the tools easier to build and run on modern systems.

The tools are being rewritten in C++ and use SDL2 as a compatibility layer for
cross-platform support.

# Goals

Quake Tools aims to:

- Faithfully reproduce the behavior of the original Quake tools, including the
  QuakeC compiler and map utilities.
- Improve portability across platforms without changing core behavior.
- Serve as a foundation for studying or modifying the Quake toolchain.
- Provide clean, readable C++ code suitable for learning and extension.
